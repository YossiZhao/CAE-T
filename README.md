## Introduction

The proposed **CAE-T framework** is a novel method for EEG abnormality detection, combining a channelwise CNN-based autoencoder with a single-head transformer classifier. This approach effectively addresses challenges in EEG analysis, such as the high dimensionality, complexity of long-term signals, and the need for biologically interpretable features.

Key highlights of our study:
- **Efficient Processing**: Handles long-term EEG signals with reduced computational costs.
- **Interpretability**: Retains biologically meaningful features, aligning with EEG channel independence.
- **Competitive Results**: Achieved 85.0% accuracy, 76.2% sensitivity, and 91.2% specificity on the TUH Abnormal EEG Corpus.

The frameworkâ€™s workflow involves:
1. Preprocessing raw EEG signals.
2. Feature extraction using the channelwise autoencoder.
3. Classification using the transformer model.
